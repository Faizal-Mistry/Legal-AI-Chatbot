            **Answer:**
            A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a formal agreement that outlines terms and mutual understanding between parties before entering into a legal contract. It defines the scope, responsibilities, and intent of collaboration but is usually **not legally binding** unless specified.

            **Summary:** MoUs record mutual intentions and serve as a foundation for future contracts.
